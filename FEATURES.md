# JiraVision Features

Inventory of what is actually shipped, verified by locating each feature's files. All paths
relative to repo root. The V2 brief's 15-item feature list (§5b "Feature set") is covered
below with its real implementation status; §3 lists gaps honestly.

## 1. Shipped features

### Homepage interactive demos (19 sections, `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`)

| 6 | Keyboard-first section: live buttons that dispatch `jv-open-search` / `jv-open-help`; kbd cheat table | `components/sections/keyboard-first.tsx` | events from `components/features/site-search.tsx` | — |
| 7 | Seat-slider pricing teaser: seats 5–100, monthly/annual −20%, per-plan totals | `components/sections/pricing-seats.tsx` | `seatModel` in `content/home.ts` | — |

### Global interaction features

Recent searches: localStorage, max 5, via `useSyncExternalStore`. Suggested group on empty query; Actions → keyboard help. Mounted once in `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` |
| 9 | Pricing page: full calculator island (plan pill + seats + billing toggle driving totals) + ROI cost-vs-time estimator with illustrative-model disclaimer + comparison table + anchor nav + 8-item FAQ | `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`, `pricing-calculator.tsx`, `content/pricing-page.ts`, `lib/calculations/roi.ts` | |
| 10 | Templates library `/templates`: all 12 templates, search + category chips + sort, per-template Radix Dialog, working Copy checklist (clipboard → execCommand → textarea fallback), Download .md (Blob), request form POSTing to `/api/contact` | `app/(marketing)/templates/{page.tsx,templates-library.tsx,template-request-form.tsx}` | |
| 11 | `/compare` hub + 5 pages (generic-jira, asana, linear, trello, notion): semantic tables, no competitor prices/logos, "verify on their site" note, demos mapped per angle | `app/(marketing)/compare/page.tsx` + 5 subdirs, `content/compare.ts` | |
| 12 | `/migration` planner: source buttons, team-size slider, attachment/parallel-run switches, 28-item checklist + progress bar, .txt download, localStorage persistence (`useSyncExternalStore`) | `app/(marketing)/migration/{page.tsx,migration-planner.tsx,migration-plan.ts}`, `content/migration.ts` | Hour model `(base + perSeat×size) × sourceFactor`, labelled illustrative |
| 13 | `/roadmap`: now/next/later with explicit commitment levels, "never on this roadmap" refusal band, priority process | `app/(marketing)/roadmap/page.tsx`, `content/roadmap.ts` | |
| 14 | `/status`: per-component manifest table, derived `overallStatus` (feeds topbar + footer chip), honest email-delivery "degraded" row, process-not-history incident wording | `app/(marketing)/status/page.tsx`, `content/status.ts`, chips in `components/layout/{footer,announcement-bar}.tsx` | Hand-maintained, no automated checks |
| 15 | Forms stack: contact page 3-tab forms (message/demo/quote with timezone detection), careers Apply dialog + general application | `components/forms/{contact-form-tabs,contact-form,demo-form,quote-form,apply-form,honeypot-field}.tsx`, `app/(marketing)/{contact,careers}` | RHF + zodResolver (`lib/forms/schemas.ts`), hidden honeypot, POST to route handlers |
| 16 | API route handlers: `/api/contact`, `/api/demo`, `/api/quote`, `/api/careers`, `/api/newsletter`, `/api/newsletter/confirm` (GET) | `app/api/*/route.ts`, pipeline in `lib/forms/handler.ts` | Order: honeypot → fake success (no learn-back); per-IP rate limit (`lib/rate-limit.ts`) — **default 3/min** via `formRoute` (brief said 5/min; only `/api/newsletter` uses `max: 5`); zod per-field errors; store via `lib/data/json-store.ts` adapters (`submissions.ts`, `subscribers.ts` in gitignored `data/*.json`); email via `lib/email.ts` (Resend if `JIRAVISION_RESEND_API`, else dev-log) |
| 17 | Newsletter double opt-in | footer capture (`components/layout/footer.tsx`) → pending record + confirm link → `GET /api/newsletter/confirm` → `/newsletter/confirm?status=ok|invalid` page (`app/(marketing)/newsletter/confirm/`) | `lib/data/subscribers.ts` |
| 18 | Cookie consent + analytics gating | `components/features/cookie-consent.tsx`, `lib/consent.ts`, `lib/analytics.ts` | Bar + preferences dialog (necessary locked); footer "Cookie preferences" re-open; Plausible adapter loads only after analytics consent + configured domain; `track()` no-ops pre-consent |
| 19 | Auth pages (restyle only; `useAuth` logic untouched) | `app/(marketing)/{login,signup,forgot-password,reset-password}/page.tsx`, shared `components/auth/auth-shell.tsx` | |
| 20 | i18n scaffold | `lib/i18n/{config.ts,use-locale.ts}`, `content/i18n.ts`, `components/layout/language-selector.tsx` | Locales en/sw/fr actually exist; EN complete, sw/fr cover nav/footer chrome strings only; persisted via `jv-locale` localStorage, unprefixed routes |

| 24 | Chrome: topbar (dismissible, status chip, docs link), scroll-aware navbar (compact h-20→h-14, hide/reveal, mega-menu FeaturedCards, mobile Sheet drawer), editorial footer (closing CTA + working newsletter, status chip, theme + language switchers, wordmark flourish, back-to-top, cookie-preferences) | `components/layout/{announcement-bar,navbar,footer,theme-toggle,language-selector}.tsx`, `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` | |
| 25 | Bottom bar: mobile persistent nav (Home/Pricing/Search/Menu, active dot, safe-area, hide-on-scroll-down) + desktop floating contextual bar (reading-progress %, CTA, dismiss persisted in sessionStorage) | `components/layout/bottom-bar.tsx` | Search tab dispatches `jv-open-search`; Menu opens the navbar drawer |

| 27 | Product/solutions/about/careers rebuilt on the page kit | `app/(marketing)/products/*` ×4, `solutions/*` ×4 (17–18 sections), `about/` (16), `careers/` + `components/features/careers-board.tsx` | Content in `content/{products,solutions,about,careers}.ts` |

## 2. Backgrounds, chrome and content infrastructure (supporting, not "features")

- Background library + `Section`/`Reveal` system — see `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §5–8.
- Content layer: 21 typed `content/*.ts` files; JSON-file data store swappable for Supabase
  (`lib/data/json-store.ts`); `data/` gitignored.
- Fonts/metadata root: Fraunces + Inter in `app/layout.tsx`; `v0.dev` generator meta removed.

## 3. Promised in the V2 brief but NOT shipped (verified by absence)

| Brief item | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| "Find your fit" quiz personalising CTAs | grep `quiz|fit-quiz|FitQuiz` matches only `REDESIGN_PLAN.md` and `COMPETITOR_RESEARCH.md` — no code, no route | Missing entirely |
| Roadmap/status **voting** | no `vote`-related code found in app/components/lib (only product-copy mention "Voting built into setup" in `content/products.ts:365`) | `/roadmap` and `/status` shipped without voting |
| Scroll-spy + copy-section-link on long-form pages | not present in `legal-doc.tsx` / TOC implementations (sticky numbered TOC with plain anchors only) | Partial: TOC yes, scroll-spy/copy-link no |
| Reading progress | exists only as the desktop bottom-bar float percentage, not per-article | Partial |
| Printable one-pagers **per product** | one consolidated `/one-pager` covering all products | Partial |
| Responsible-AI "transparency center" as a destination | shipped as pieces instead: homepage `ResponsibleAi` section, sandbox per-ticket rationale, equity "Why this number?" panel, `/products/ethical-metrics` refusal list — no standalone center route | Partial / redistributed |
| Playwright smoke tests + unit tests for calculator logic | no `tests/`, `e2e/`, or `__tests__/` dirs; no test script in `package.json` (task V2-6a still in progress) | Not shipped |
| SEO: sitemap, robots, OG/Twitter, JSON-LD | no `app/sitemap.ts`, no `app/robots.ts`, no `public/sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`; `export const metadata` exists on only 5 of 27 marketing entries (home, contact, careers, changelog, newsletter/confirm) | Not shipped (V2-6b pending) |
| Lighthouse 90+ perf pass, a11y audit pass | Phase V2-6d pending | Not verified |

## 4. Known behavior notes

- Rate limits are per-process memory (`lib/rate-limit.ts`) — fine on one server instance,
  not shared across serverless invocations.
- Forms store to local JSON via the adapter; in production (serverless) writes to
  `data/*.json` will not persist across cold starts until the hosted adapter lands
  (roadmap "Hosted data layer", listed as exploratory).
- Team emails currently do not send: `JIRAVISION_RESEND_API` returns 401 (see
  `PLACEHOLDERS.md`). Submissions still store and report success.
- `GoogleMap` on `/contact` renders only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set;
  otherwise a fallback card links to Google Maps search (`components/google-map.tsx`).
- Legacy `/resources/{blog,case-studies,webinars,documentation}` pages are live but still
  contain v0-era fabricated testimonials and stats — see `PLACEHOLDERS.md` §Content; they
  contradict the site's honesty conventions and are a launch blocker.
