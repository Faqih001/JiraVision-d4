# JiraVision API Test Summary

This document summarizes the state of the API endpoints after testing and fixing database setup issues.

## Database Status
- ✅ All database tables have been created successfully
- ✅ User permissions fixed to allow proper access to tables
- ✅ Test users created successfully (admin@example.com, user@example.com, etc.)
- ✅ Chat data has been seeded (but not participants)

## API Endpoint Status
- ✅ `/api/auth/session` - 200 OK - Returns user session information
- ✅ `/api/auth/login` - 200 OK - Successfully authenticates users
- ✅ `/api/chat` - 200 OK - Returns chat list (empty array as expected)
- ✅ `/api/db-test` - 200 OK - Confirms database connectivity
- ❌ `/api/auth/status` - 404 Not Found - Endpoint does not exist
- ❌ `/api/chat/list` - 404 Not Found - Use `/api/chat` instead
- ❓ `/api/dashboard/tasks` - 401 Unauthorized - Needs valid session

## Issues Fixed
1. Database permission issues fixed by granting proper privileges to the `jiravision_dev` user
2. Login API tested and working correctly with FormData (not JSON)
3. Session management confirmed working correctly
4. Chat API confirmed working correctly

## Next Steps
1. The application is now ready for use with the working APIs
2. Add more chat participants using the user IDs
3. Test the dashboard API with an authenticated user
4. Test other APIs as needed

## Conclusion
The local database has been set up properly and the core authentication and chat APIs are functioning as expected. There are some missing or renamed API endpoints compared to what was initially tested, but the main functionality is working correctly.
