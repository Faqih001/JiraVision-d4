# JiraVision API Test Summary

This document summarizes the state of the API endpoints after testing and fixing database setup issues.

## Database Status

- ✅ All database tables have been created successfully
- ✅ User permissions fixed to allow proper access to tables
- ✅ Test users created successfully (<admin@example.com>, <user@example.com>, etc.)
- ✅ New test users successfully created via registration API (<test.user.1803@example.com>)
- ✅ Chat data has been seeded (but not participants)
- ✅ Task data has been seeded with various statuses, priorities, and tags

## API Endpoint Status

- ✅ `/api/auth/session` - 200 OK - Returns user session information
- ✅ `/api/auth/login` - 200 OK - Successfully authenticates users
- ✅ `/api/auth/register` - 200 OK - Successfully creates new user accounts
- ✅ `/api/chat` - 200 OK - Returns chat list for authenticated users
- ✅ `/api/dashboard/tasks` - 200 OK - Returns populated task list with 15 tasks
- ✅ `/api/db-test` - 200 OK - Confirms database connectivity
- ✅ `/api/sprints` - 200 OK - Returns list of all sprints
- ✅ `/api/sprints/[id]` - 200 OK - Returns details for a specific sprint
- ✅ `/api/sprints/[id]/tasks` - 200 OK - Returns tasks for a specific sprint
- ❌ `/api/auth/status` - 404 Not Found - Endpoint does not exist
- ❌ `/api/chat/list` - 404 Not Found - Use `/api/chat` instead

## Issues Fixed

1. Database permission issues fixed by granting proper privileges to the `jiravision_dev` user
2. Login API tested and working correctly with FormData (not JSON)
3. Session management confirmed working correctly
4. Chat API confirmed working correctly
5. Registration API implemented and tested successfully
6. Dashboard tasks API tested and confirmed working

## Implemented Solutions

### Registration API Endpoint

Created the missing registration endpoint at `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` that:

- Accepts form data with user details (name, email, password)
- Automatically sets confirmPassword to match password for API usage
- Calls the existing signup function from auth-actions.ts
- Returns the newly created user object on success

### Task API Fixes

Fixed issues with task API endpoints:

- Corrected date handling in task creation and updates to use string format compatible with PostgreSQL
- Fixed null safety issues with session handling in task creation
- Added proper types to updateTask function to resolve TS compilation errors
- Fixed query building in getPaginatedTasks to properly apply multiple filter conditions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Seed task data for testing dashboard tasks API with actual content
2. ✅ Create a sprint and assign tasks to the sprint for testing sprint-related features
3. ✅ Create and test sprint-related API endpoints
4. ✅ Fix task API date handling for PostgreSQL compatibility
5. Create and test additional API endpoints for:
   - Task creation and management
   - User profile management
   - Team management
   - Wellbeing metrics
6. Implement frontend integration with the API endpoints
7. Add pagination to list endpoints for performance with larger datasets

## Conclusion

The local database has been set up properly and all core authentication APIs are now functioning correctly. We've successfully implemented the missing registration API endpoint and verified that all basic functionality works as expected. The application is now ready for further development of task management features and more advanced functionality.
